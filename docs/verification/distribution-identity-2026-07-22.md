# Public distribution verification — 2026-07-22

## Canonical identity

- Canonical application repository: `https://github.com/stancsz/marmot`
- Public homepage: `https://super-marmot.github.io/`
- GitHub metadata was verified after update: the homepage points to the live
  site, the description names the share-to-action loop, Discussions are
  enabled, and the latest release remains `v0.1.0`.
- The separate Pages repository has a pending synchronized `index.html` change
  in the local checkout; it is not considered published until the selected
  proof assets are committed to Marmot, pushed, then the Pages commit is pushed
  and its raw/live URLs are rechecked.

## Live checks

- Cache-busting homepage request returned HTTP 200 with title
  `Marmot — from shared screenshot to phone action`, the flagship promise,
  the stable APK link, and no stale Pages-repository link.
- `https://github.com/stancsz/marmot/releases/latest/download/marmot.apk`
  returned HTTP 200 with `application/vnd.android.package-archive` and a
  `175874623`-byte artifact.
- Visual proof: [homepage-share-to-action-2026-07-22.png](homepage-share-to-action-2026-07-22.png)
  shows the share-to-action hero, local-only copy, Quick actions screen, and
  Android download CTA.

## Repository gates

- 32 Jest suites / 192 tests passed.
- TypeScript passed with `npx tsc --noEmit`.
- Android export passed with `npx expo export --platform android`.
- All 10 product verifiers and their adequacy audits passed.
- `python scripts/ship_gate.py` passed.

## Known limitations

The current GitHub release is development-signed for sideloading. Production
Android signing, Google Play, TestFlight/App Store distribution, and the
external-app screenshot/message → typed action E2E flow remain open milestones.
