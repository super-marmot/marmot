## What is Marmot?

Marmot is a lightweight iOS + Android app that does for phones what
[Ollama](https://ollama.com) does for laptops: pick a model from a curated
library, download it once, and chat with it locally. Inference runs on your
device with [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) — Metal-accelerated
on iOS, ARM-optimized CPU on Android.

Instead of exposing thousands of models, Marmot ships **one champion per
weight class** — the highest-rated open model at each size a phone can run,
as of July 2026 — each with a RAM-fit badge computed from your device's
actual memory so you know before downloading whether it will run comfortably.

## Screens

| Home | Chat | Model library |

## Features

- 🔒 **Fully private** — the only network traffic is the one-time model
  download from Hugging Face. Chats never leave the device.
- ⚡ **Streaming responses** with per-reply tokens/sec stats.
- 📦 **Resumable downloads** that survive app restarts — pause, resume,
  cancel, delete. A `.gguf` on disk is always complete (downloads write to a
  `.part` file and move atomically).
- 🧠 **RAM-fit badges** — "Runs great / Should run / May be too big" based on
  your device's total memory vs. model size.
- 🤔 **Reasoning-model aware** — Qwen3.5 and SmolLM3's `<think>…</think>`
  blocks are folded into a "Thinking…" indicator instead of leaking raw tags
  into the chat.
- 🎛️ **Tunable sampling** — temperature, top-p, max tokens, context length
  (2k/4k/8k), and a custom system prompt.
- 🪶 **Lightweight** — ~2 MB JS bundle, no backend, one model in memory at a
  time (switching models releases the previous context first).

## Model catalog

| Class | Model | Download | Runs on | Why it's the pick |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🪶 Featherweight | Qwen3.5 0.8B | 0.53 GB | any phone | Rated far above every other sub-1B; 200+ languages |
| 🥊 Lightweight | Qwen3.5 2B | 1.28 GB | 4–6 GB RAM | Beats Gemma 4 E2B on reasoning, GPQA, intelligence |
| 🥋 Middleweight | SmolLM3 3B | 1.92 GB | 6 GB RAM | Strongest fully-open 3B, dual-mode reasoning |
| 🏋️ Cruiserweight | Qwen3.5 4B | 2.74 GB | 8 GB RAM | Strongest dense 4B: knowledge, science, agentic wins |
| 👑 Heavyweight | Gemma 4 E4B | 4.06 GB | 12 GB+ RAM | 8B weights at a 4B footprint; closest to cloud quality |

All Apache 2.0. Q4_K_M GGUF builds (Gemma 4 E4B ships as Q3_K_M to stay
phone-sized) from [unsloth](https://huggingface.co/unsloth), with URLs and
exact byte sizes verified against the hosted files. Rankings from
[Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai) and per-tier benchmark
comparisons; re-evaluated as new models ship.

## Getting started

Marmot uses native modules, so it needs a development build (not Expo Go).

**Prerequisites:** Node 20+, and Android Studio (Android) or Xcode on macOS (iOS).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meowju/marmot.git
cd marmot
npm install

npx expo run:android   # Android
npx expo run:ios       # iOS (macOS only)
```

`expo run` generates the native `android/` and `ios/` projects automatically
(continuous native generation) — they are disposable and not checked in.

> **Windows note:** if llama.rn's postinstall fails with a tar error under Git
> Bash, rerun it with Windows' native tar:
> `PATH="/c/Windows/System32:$PATH" node node_modules/llama.rn/install/download-native-artifacts.js`

## Architecture

```
src/
  models/catalog.ts      # curated model list (id, URL, exact size, license)
  lib/
    engine.ts            # single global llama.cpp context; load/unload/stream
    downloads.ts         # resumable downloads → .part file → atomic move
    chatStore.ts         # AsyncStorage persistence for chats + settings
    deviceMemory.ts      # RAM-fit heuristic (total RAM vs model size)
    thinking.ts          # <think>…</think> splitter for reasoning models
  screens/
    ChatListScreen.tsx   # home: conversation history
    ChatScreen.tsx       # streaming chat + model picker strip
    ModelsScreen.tsx     # library: download/pause/resume/delete + fit badges
    SettingsScreen.tsx   # sampling params, context length, system prompt
```

**Stack:** React Native (Expo SDK 57) · [llama.rn](https://github.com/mybigday/llama.rn) · TypeScript.

## Adding a model to the catalog

One entry in [`src/models/catalog.ts`](src/models/catalog.ts):

```ts
{
  id: 'my-model-1b',
  name: 'My Model 1B',
  family: 'Vendor',
  params: '1B',
  quant: 'Q4_K_M',
  sizeBytes: 807_694_464,        // exact — verify with: curl -sIL <url> | grep -i content-length
  url: 'https://huggingface.co/…/resolve/main/….gguf',
  description: 'One or two sentences on what it is good at.',
  license: 'Apache 2.0',
  thinking: false,               // true if it emits <think> blocks
}
```

Catalog PRs are welcome, with two constraints: the model must run acceptably
on a mid-range phone (≤ ~2.5 GB quantized), and the size must be the exact
byte count of the hosted file — the download manager and RAM-fit badges
depend on it.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Markdown rendering in chat bubbles
- [ ] Import any local `.gguf` from the Files app
- [ ] Background downloads
- [ ] Android GPU (OpenCL/Vulkan) inference where supported
- [ ] Prompt templates / saved personas
- [ ] Basic RAG over local documents

## Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome. For anything non-trivial, open an issue first so
we can agree on the approach. To hack on the app:

```bash
npm install
npx tsc --noEmit     # typecheck
npx expo run:android # run on a device/emulator
```

Please keep the project's constraints in mind: no backend services, no
analytics, no accounts — Marmot stays local-only by design.
